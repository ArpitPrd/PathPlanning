A* is just like djikstra + a heuristic function
Path planning is an operation performed to compute a kinematically-feasible curve in space connecting a point A with a point B
1. From the constraints, create a convex optimisation problem, i.e. integrate all the constraints to a single cost function to be optimised. If there are other constraints like collision avoidance, then we need to put them algebrically.
2. Then there is another approach to obtain the optimisation problem, that is through stochastic modelling. 
3. AI based algorithms -> Can heavily reduce the computational power.
