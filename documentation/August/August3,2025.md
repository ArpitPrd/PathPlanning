Tasks to do:
1. Implement the brownian motion code written by Prasad
- Find out the inferences from that, like at what time 90% area gets covered, etc.
- *Future task:* Find a concrete modelling for the brownian motion

2. Search for the papers on git hub
3. Make three slides in the presentation
- Modelling of the space
- Brownian motion data
- If I can find a possible comparison from the research papers




Points to be noted:
- A drone does know its speed, through sensor fusion mechanisms
- Brownian motion is a very random process, which very much depends on the initialisation of the drones.
