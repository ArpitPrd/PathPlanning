What is the baseline performance?? 

### Applications:
- Surveillance of the IIT campus using n drones, with good time and computation constraints
- There are some pre-defined no-fly zone
- There will be some obstruction -> maybe static or dynamic



### Modelling:
###### Environment:
- AoI
- Defining the area as a composition of different units

###### Agent(s):
- A set of k drones 
- Speed -> prolly constant
- Maximum angle of deflection



Discussions:
- PyMoo is a library, which has multi-objective optimization


Current status:
1. We have a baseline which is brownian motion
2. We have all the open source algorithms which're present on github which can satisfy our requirements
3. Tesii wala paper also do 3d drone handling
4. We will try to analyze things, based on different pre-implemented models
