1. Monitoring terrains
2. Exponentially growing computational requriements
3. A novel muti-agent deep RL-based IPP approach is the mail contribution
4. Adaptive path planning strategies are online based on incoming sensor data
5. A paper by nature shows the A* algorithm for a single UAV planning.
6. [[chen_auto_repath.pdf]]     -> Graph based RL method for reducing uncertainity [[multi-drones.pdf]] extended it to 3-D
7. [[Multi-UAV_Adaptive_Path_Planning_Using_Deep_Reinfo.pdf]] extends the method to multi-agent, but naively, which inturn leads to an exponential complexity
8. Introduction of **Credit Assignment Problem** [[KaganTumer_credit_assignment.pdf]] -> Do not discriminate the contri by one agent compared to whole group
9. Mapping a terrain by a downward facing camera, then a offline agent based on global terrain information
10. I think we should not go for the 3D movement one, because when we always fix a resolution with which we carry out. Rather than that, we can do this terrain mapping part if requried. 
11. Platforms:
