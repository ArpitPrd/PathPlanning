Biologically inspired algorithms are stochastic and metaheuristic search algorithm from a computational perspective.
- They **imitate biological processes** (evolution, swarm behavior, etc.)
- They **use randomness** to explore and improve solution
- They’re **metaheuristics** — general frameworks for finding good (often near-optimal) solutions to complex problems
Metaheuristics are somethings that is a more general form of heuristic for balancing exploration, and exploitation. 

Bio-inspired algorithms are commonly used in path optimization algorithms for UAVs owing to their several benefits. The first advantage of bio-inspired algorithms is that they are robust even under adverse conditions because they have self-organized patterns [15 ]. Second, they can readily adapt to dynamic environments [16 , 17]. Path planning, trajectory generation, and control systems are major concerns in UAV automation.

 UAVs can maximize their performance and efficiency by exploring all decisions using GPS, cameras, and various sensors [ 39 ]. This research paper can be used in future
