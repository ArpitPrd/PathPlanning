## What is our final goal (Possibilities)

1. Flying drones for power efficiency, time, duration
2. Flying drones to cover various depths of details at the cost of reduced span frame
3. Exploration of an unknown environment with no prior history
4. 

## Ideas that can be used to implement

1. Use LLMs for tracking between machines
2. Multiple agents surving together
3. PYMOO for solving multiobjective problem (time, drones)
4. height and resolution
5. policy and a subpolicy
6. Share between exploration and exploitation ([link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3477314.3507052))
